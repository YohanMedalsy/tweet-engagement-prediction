# Tweet Engagement Prediction

This work is building on my masters thesis at the Information Systems chair
of TU Darmstadt.
Our goal is to build deep learning models capable of predicting eventual
retweet counts.

## Setup

Valid Twitter credentials are needed in order establish an API connection.
Credentials should be stored in an `.env` file and will be loaded in the
respective modules.
